This is a Simple demonstration of working of a Notes App. This provides us several actions like:
* Adding a new notes to the json file called "notes.json" and taking care of redundancy so that no duplicate note should be added.
* Removing a note from the notes.json if the given title is present otherwise it throws an error.
* Showing the details about a note by taking its title as input this operation is called Read Operation.
* List all the notes present in notes.json file.
